# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

# Overview:

This project was created for Household Energy consumption prediction using ARIMA model. 

# Features: 

- The script presents quick data analysis of the data. 
- Preparing data for training and testing ARIMA model.
- Algorithm is well noted with every singles steps (for learning purposes).

# Running The Project
- Project can be clone and run on Python with Jupyter Notebook. 

# Small note and conclusion

Deep and complex machine learning models might not perform as well as suitable machine learning model. Sometimes just by moving along the average can give you the good results and ofcourse it has to base on Educated Guessing Direction.
